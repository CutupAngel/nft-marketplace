On the Ethereum blockchain, gas is an execution fee used to compensate miners for the computational resources required to power smart contracts. Network usage is progressively increasing, with current gas costs being millions of dollars per day. As the ecosystem continues to grow, so too will the value of gas optimization. The following sections will go over some common gas optimization patterns.

## Knowledge of gas optimize

- Gas-Saving Patterns
  The following are patterns you can make use of in your code to reduce gas consumption.

- Short-circuiting
  Short-circuiting is a strategy we can make use of when an operation makes use of either `||` or `&&`. This pattern works by ordering the lower-cost operation first so that the higher-cost operation may be skipped (short-circuited) if the first operation evaluates to `true`.
